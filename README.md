My implementation of diceware

<h1>Diceware Implementation</h2>
<p>Diceware is a form of passphrase generation. Where you build a dictionary with a key and an associated string.</br>You roll one die, or five at once and write down the numbers that you got until you have a total of five.</br> Then find the associated string with the key (the rolled numbers) you got.</p>

<p>Inspiration comes from this article from threatpost</p>
